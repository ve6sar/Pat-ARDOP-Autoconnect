# Pat-ARDOP-Autoconnect
This script works in conjunction with KM4ACK's getardop script 
to make a list of ardop stations based on their distance from 
the users station and work outwards trying to connect to RMS
stations using the PAT CLI until it is able to make a connection 
and pass any traffic.

You will need to edit the path and location sections to suit your installation
